# OT-based-Heterogeneous-Multi-Modal-Fusion-Embedding-for-AD-analysis-

Original code for OT from https://github.com/Qinkaiyu/RIMA

The currenct code is a modified version of the above to encompass heterogenous MultiModal AD data

Current code takes MRI and PET data from ADNI
Currently working on a fix for jax dependency for faster training

## Credits
- OT module is based on RIMA: https://github.com/Qinkaiyu/RIMA
- This repository modifies and extends the original implementation to support heterogeneous multi-modal AD data.
